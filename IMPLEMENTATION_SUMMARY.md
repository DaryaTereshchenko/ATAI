# Implementation Summary: Factual and Embedding Approaches

## Overview

This implementation adds support for two distinct approaches to answering natural language questions about movies, as specified in the problem statement:

1. **Factual Approach**: Transform NL question â†’ SPARQL query â†’ Execute on knowledge graph â†’ Return all answers concatenated with "and"
2. **Embedding Approach**: Extract entity and relation â†’ Compute in embedding space using TransE â†’ Return single answer with entity type

## Problem Requirements Met

### âœ… Approach Detection
- System detects whether query asks for "factual approach", "embedding approach", or both
- If not specified, uses both approaches
- Examples:
  - `"Please answer this question with a factual approach: ..."` â†’ Factual only
  - `"Please answer this question with an embedding approach: ..."` â†’ Embedding only
  - `"Please answer this question: ..."` â†’ Both

### âœ… Factual Approach Implementation
- Converts natural language to SPARQL queries (using existing NL2SPARQL pipeline)
- Executes queries on the knowledge graph
- Returns **all** answers concatenated with "and"
- Order of answers doesn't matter
- Format: `"The factual answer is: <answer1> and <answer2> and ..."`

Example:
```
Query: "Please answer this question with a factual approach: Who directed 'Fargo'?"
Output: "The factual answer is: Ethan Coen and Joel Coen"
```

### âœ… Embedding Approach Implementation
- Extracts subject entity and relation from natural language query
- Performs TransE computation: `answer_embedding â‰ˆ subject_embedding + relation_embedding`
- Finds nearest entity in embedding space
- Returns **single** answer with entity type
- Format: `"The answer suggested by embeddings is: <answer> (type: <QID>)"`

Example:
```
Query: "Please answer this question with an embedding approach: Who is the director of 'Apocalypse Now'?"
Output: "The answer suggested by embeddings is: John Milius (type: Q5)"
```

### âœ… Entity Type Detection
Embedding responses include Wikidata entity type codes:
- **Q5**: Person (directors, actors, screenwriters, producers)
- **Q201658**: Film genre
- **Q6256**: Country
- **Q11424**: Film/Movie
- **Q618779**: Award
- **Q35120**: Entity (generic fallback)

### âœ… Both Approaches Combined
When no approach is specified, system uses both and combines results:

Example:
```
Query: "Please answer this question: Who is the director of 'Good Will Hunting'?"
Output: "The factual answer is: Gus Van Sant. The answer suggested by embeddings is: Harmony Korine (type: Q5)"
```

## Example Queries from Problem Statement

All example queries are supported:

### Factual Approach Examples

1. **Country**: `"From what country is the movie 'Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino'?"`
   - Expected: `"The factual answer is: Mexico"`

2. **Screenwriter**: `"Who is the screenwriter of 'Shortcut to Happiness'?"`
   - Expected: `"The factual answer is: Pete Dexter"`

3. **Director (multiple)**: `"Who directed 'Fargo'?"`
   - Expected: `"The factual answer is: Ethan Coen and Joel Coen"`

4. **Genre (multiple)**: `"What genre is the movie 'Bandit Queen'?"`
   - Expected: `"The factual answer is: drama film and biographical film and crime film"`

5. **Release date**: `"When did the movie 'Miracles Still Happen' come out?"`
   - Expected: `"The factual answer is: 1974-07-19"`

### Embedding Approach Examples

1. **Director**: `"Who is the director of 'Apocalypse Now'?"`
   - Expected: `"The answer suggested by embeddings is: John Milius (type: Q5)"`

2. **Screenwriter**: `"Who is the screenwriter of '12 Monkeys'?"`
   - Expected: `"The answer suggested by embeddings is: Carol Florence (type: Q5)"`

3. **Genre**: `"What is the genre of 'Shoplifters'?"`
   - Expected: `"The answer suggested by embeddings is: comedy film (type: Q201658)"`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.main.orchestrator import Orchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = Orchestrator(use_workflow=True)

# Process a query
response = orchestrator.process_query(
    "Please answer this question with a factual approach: Who directed 'Fargo'?"
)
print(response)
# Output: "The factual answer is: Ethan Coen and Joel Coen"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run test suite
python tests/test_dual_approaches.py

# Run demo
python demo_dual_approaches.py
```

## Data Requirements

To use the system with actual data, you need:

1. **Knowledge Graph**: RDF/N-Triples file with movie data
   - Place at: `data/14_graph.nt`

2. **TransE Embeddings**: Pre-computed entity and relation embeddings
   - Place at: `data/embeddings/`
   - Required files:
     - `entity_embeds.npy`
     - `entity_ids.del`
     - `relation_embeds.npy`
     - `relation_ids.del`

## Integration
