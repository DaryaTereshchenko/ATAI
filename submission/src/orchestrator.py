orchestrator.py
---------------

This module ties together the knowledge graph, embeddings and various
subsystems (query parsing, recommendation, multimedia) to answer natural
language questions.  The primary entry point is the :func:`answer_question`
function which returns a humanâ€‘readable answer string.

The orchestrator maintains singleton instances of the heavy components
(`KnowledgeGraph`, `EmbeddingModel`, `RelationsMapping`) to avoid repeated
loading.  Paths to the underlying data files must be provided when
instantiating the orchestrator.
